# Text Classification AI

This repository demonstrates how to build a **text classification model** using Python.  
It solves one of the most common AI problems: **categorizing text** (e.g., positive/negative reviews).  

---

##  Features
- Preprocess and clean raw text
- Convert text into numerical features (TF-IDF)
- Train a machine learning classifier (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Save the trained model for later use

##  How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas
---

##  Train the model:
2. Train the model:

   python train_model.py

## Example Datasettext,label:
I love this product,positive

This is the worst experience ever,negative

The service was okay,neutral
